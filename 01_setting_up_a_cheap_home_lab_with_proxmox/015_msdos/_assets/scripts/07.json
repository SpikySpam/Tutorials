I have prepared a small docker container which has 7 ZIP installed inside. So I don't need to install another tool. Just run the create iso script in the assets folder of this video. This script will spin up a container that will Unpack the 7-Zip file into multiple Image-files. Those Image-files will be further Extracted into Raw files. The last command in the script will create a Bootable ISO-file from the Raw files."
