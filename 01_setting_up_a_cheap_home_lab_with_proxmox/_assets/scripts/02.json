For this tutorial, I have an old desktop, and old laptop and an old MacBook I will install ProxMox on. For this we are going to use a tool called Ventoy, which you can download from their website. If you navigate to their download section you can click on the link to download a zip file. This will bring you to their GitHub release page on which you will find the latest downloadable version."
