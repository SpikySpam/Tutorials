I also forwarded port 7000 on my Router. This is the port Vaultwarden will use. I added an A record to my self-hosted domain name server. I have added an entry in my self-hosted Engine X Proxy Manager. And I downloaded the latest sources. For a video about that you can click the link that's popping up right now."
