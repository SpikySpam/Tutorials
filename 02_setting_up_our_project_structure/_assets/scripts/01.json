You can click the link that is popping up now for a video about that. You can find all bash commands and project sources at my GitHub page. In a folder with the same name as this video. In this video you see me cut and paste all commands from my GitHub page directly into an Ubuntu terminal. I will try to explain at each step, what exactly we are doing. Let's go!"
