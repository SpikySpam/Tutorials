In a much, much, later video we are going to automate NPM entries by calling its API. This also requires us to login with a username and password. If you follow along with this project structure, we get those values always from our environment variables. You will see much, much later why I choose to setup my environment like this. First we are going to concentrate to setup some open source applications in our homelab that will help us to create a pretty good maintainable project. So see you in the next video. Spiky out!"
