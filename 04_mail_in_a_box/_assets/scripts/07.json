And uses Engine X as a simple web server. It uses Roundcube as your web e-mail client. Next cloud as your contact list and calendar apps. Mail in a Box has been fully configured for you by the creator and its contributors. Go give Joshua a star on Github please. This is a real time saver. Provide a strong password for your admin e-mail account. This should be the same as earlier specified in your bash profile script. After that we have completed the installation, as easy as saying bonjour."
