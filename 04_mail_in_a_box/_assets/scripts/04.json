Since mail in a box comes with a fully maintainable domain name server, we are going to prepare our nameserver records at our domain registrars dashboard. I'm using Hostgator, so this could be a little different for you, but the idea is to create 2 glue records pointing to your droplet. And then to specify those records as your name servers."
