Hi,

Spiky here.

I have managed to recreate the Apple Basic application that is used in the video clip, by Grandaddy. Beautiful Ground.

Enjoy

Apparently before Jed had left us

He wrote some poems

Wrote them for no one

But I guess I'll show them

Here's one of Jed's poems

You said I'd wake up dead drunk alone in a park

I called you a liar, but how right you were

Air-conditioned TV land, 20 grand, walk to the bank

With shakes from the night before staring at the tiki floor

High-school wedding ring, keys are under the mats

Of all the houses here, but not the motels

I try to sing it funny like Beck, it's bringing me down

Lower than ground

Beautiful ground

Beautiful ground

Test tones and failed clones
And odd parts made you
