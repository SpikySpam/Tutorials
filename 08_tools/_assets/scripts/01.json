And List Monk. Things are getting easier. For sure that Docker stuff. These video's are getting shorter and more to the point. At least, if you did follow my previous 3 or 4 videos. Installing those apps should be a no brainer now. A reminder, you can find all latest sources at my GitHub page. Let's go!"
